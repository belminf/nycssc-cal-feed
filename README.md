Scrapes NYC Social's EZFacility schedule webpage and creates calendar feed. Would probably work with other EZFacility leagues with minor modifications.

Requires some system packages:
```
yum install -y libxml-devel libxslt-devel python-virtualenv python-pip 
```

Create a virtualenv:
```
virtualenv --no-site-packages nycssc-cal
```

Install python requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, add a cronjob to run `script.py`.
